# SOFTENG 206 Assignment 2

Jeopardy game made for one of my assignments for university.
It's fairly intuitive, questions can be added to categories folder, using the same format as you can see in the provided questions. You'll need to restart the game if you add new questions for it to actually generate them.

## Getting Started

Just have to run Jeopardy.sh from terminal, it should already have permissions but might need to be given them.
If you're not my intrsutors/markers for this then you'll need to edit the Jeopardy.sh files to have your specific file path for JavaFx-11.

### Prerequisites

categories folder goes on same level as .jar.
Only works on linux
